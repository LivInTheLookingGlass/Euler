C Implementation of Problem 12
==============================

View source code :source:`c/src/p0012.c`

.. note::

   While this is a complete solution, and will eventually complete, until :c:struct:`prime_counter` utilizes the prime sieve
   (as opposed to the current implementation that searches naively with a cache) it will be quite slow. That conversion is underway.

Includes
--------

- `factors.h <./lib/factors.html>`__

Solution
--------

.. c:function:: uint64_t p0012()

.. c:function:: int main(int argc, char const *argv[])

   .. note:: 
      
      This function is only present in the Python test runner, or when compiling as a standalone program.
      It is not present when compiling for the Unity test runner.
