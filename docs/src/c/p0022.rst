C Implementation of Problem 22
==============================

View source code :source:`c/src/p0022.c`

.. note::

   Because this proble requires file I/O, it includes the standard library.
   Unfortunately, I have never been able to make ``pcc`` compile while including that.
   This may change in futute releases. All other compilers are supported.

Includes
--------

- `macros.h <./lib/macros.html>`__
- `utils.h <./lib/utils.html>`__

Solution
--------

.. c:function:: int cmpstr(const void *a, const void *b)

  A wrapper around ``strcmp()`` to adapt it for ``qsort()``

.. c:function:: uint64_t p0022()

.. c:function:: int main(int argc, char const *argv[])

   .. note:: 
      
      This function is only present in the Python test runner, or when compiling as a standalone program.
      It is not present when compiling for the Unity test runner.
