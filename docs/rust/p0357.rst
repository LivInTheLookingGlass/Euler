Rust Implementation of Problem 357
==================================

.. note::

   While this is a complete solution, and will eventually complete, until ``proper_divisors<I>()`` returns an iterator
   (as opposed to the current implementation that returns a vector) it will be quite slow. That conversion is underway.
