! Project Euler Problem 5
!
! I modeled this after the C++ solution, because it was by far the simplest
!
! Problem:
!
! A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
! the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
!
! Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
