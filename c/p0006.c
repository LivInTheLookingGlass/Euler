/*
Project Euler Problem 6

I know there is a closed form solution to sum of squares, but I didn't want to
cheat and look it up. I was able to remember the closed form formula for sum of
natural numbers, though, so this is still pretty fast.

Problem:

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.
