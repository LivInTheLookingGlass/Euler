-- Project Euler Problem 6
--
-- This turned out to be really easy
--
-- Problem:
--
-- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- 1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385
--
-- The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
-- (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025
--
-- Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
-- numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
--
-- Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
-- natural numbers and the square of the sum.

            sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares + (i * i)
        end
