This is the repository I keep for prospective employers to look at project Euler code that I have written.

This is useful because it has defined problems and answers such that you can compare answers with other people.

All solutions are tested against multiple operating systems and language/compiler versions. For more information, see `.github/workflows/`

## This is NOT meant to help others on Project Euler problems

## If you are working on Project Euler problems, DO NOT use this as a source

The repo is divided into sections for each language. The top-level Makefile will direct recipes using prefixes

- `make c*` will go to the c Makefile
- `make cs*` will go to the csharp Makefile
- `make py*` will go to the python Makefile
- `make js*` will go to the javascript Makefile

For more information, please see the README documents in each section.
