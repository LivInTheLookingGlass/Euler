# gappleto97's Project Euler solutions

This is the repository I keep for prospective employers to look at project Euler code that I have written.

This is useful because it has defined problems and answers such that you can compare answers with other people.

## This is NOT meant to help others on Project Euler problems

## If you are working on Project Euler problems, DO NOT use this as a source

The repo is divided into sections for each language. The top-level Makefile will direct recipes using prefixes

- make c_____ will go to the c Makefile
- make py______ will go to the python Makefile
- make js______ will go to the javascript Makefile
