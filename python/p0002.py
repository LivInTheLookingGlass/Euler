Project Euler Problem 2

I also decided that I like lazy functions on this one. Also seen: generator
comprehensions

Revision 1:

I split fib() up so that there is one version which limits and another which
does not.

Revision 2:

Utilize the underlying pattern of the sequence to avoid needing modulo divison,
speeding up by ~2x.

Problem:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
