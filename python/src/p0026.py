Project Euler Problem 26

Problem:

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10
are given:

.. code-block::

    1/2 = 0.5
    1/3 = 0.(3)
    1/4 = 0.25
    1/5 = 0.2
    1/6 = 0.1(6)
    1/7 = 0.(142857)
    1/8 = 0.125
    1/9 = 0.(1)
    1/10 = 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring
cycle. Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
