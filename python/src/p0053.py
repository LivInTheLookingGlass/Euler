Project Euler Problem 53

Problem:

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3=10

.

In general, nCr=n!r!(n−r)!
, where r≤n, n!=n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0!=1

.

It is not until n=23
, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10=1144066

.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of nCr
for 1≤n≤100, are greater than one-million?
