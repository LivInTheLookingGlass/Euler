/*
Project Euler Problem 4

I couldn't figure out how to do this as efficiently as I would have liked. I am
SURE that there is a better way to check if a number is a palindrome, but I
could not think of one.

Problem:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
