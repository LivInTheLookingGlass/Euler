/**
 * Project Euler Problem 4
 *
 * I couldn't figure out how to do this as efficiently as I would have liked. I am
 * SURE that there is a better way to check if a number is a palindrome, but I
 * could not think of one.
 *
 * Problem:
 *
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
 * the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 *
 * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 *
 * @return {number}
